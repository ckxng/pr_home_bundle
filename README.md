prhome_bundle
=============

This is the parkrow website 2.x release.  We moved from WordPress to Symfony in
order to move towards a more customized site, featuring a complex church
membership directory.

After some time it was determined that ExpressJS offered a more slimmed down
base, and the site was re-launched in Node.js.

This code is uploaded for the benefit of the community, who may use it however
they see fit according to the Simplified BSD License.

Status
======

This software is ABANDONED.

This software was created for Park Row Church of Christ. It lacks documentation 
and may be difficult to reuse. I do not have any interest in continuing work on 
this project, at this time.
