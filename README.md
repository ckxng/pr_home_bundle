prhome_bundle
=============

This is the parkrow website 2.x release.  We moved from WordPress to Symfony in
order to move towards a more customized site, featuring a complex church
membership directory.

After some time it was determined that ExpressJS offered a more slimmed down
base, and the site was re-launched in Node.js.
