## Looking for a safe alternative for Halloween?

Come and join us Sunday, October 27 at 5:00pm for Park Row's annual Trunk or
Treat.  Kids can jump in bounce houses, win prizes and candy, and get their
faces painted!  Our Trunk or Treat event is a safe, supervised event that the
whole family can participate in.  Come dressed in costume and enjoy a family
night out with us.

Examples of fun costume themes for your family:

- Superheros (the more original the better!)
- Similar professions
- Silly outfits
- Animal costumes
- Celebrity look-alikes
- ... get creative with it!

### Bringing a trunk?

- Please arrive between 4:00pm - 4:30pm
- There is no vehicle entry or exit during the event, plan to stay for the whole time.
- Decorate your trunk (maybe it can coordinate with your costume!)
- We are expecting 500+ participants, please bring plenty of candy and/or prizes
